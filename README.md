# CHAPTER_3
#Learning Dart Basics

This chapter covered the basics of the Dart language. I learned how to comment your code for
better readability and how to use the main() function that starts the app. I also learned how to declare
variables to reference different kinds of values such as numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and more.
You used the List to store an array of filters and learned how to iterate through each value. You
looked at operator symbols commonly used to perform arithmetic, equality, logical, conditional, and
cascade notation. The cascade notation is a powerful operator to make multiple sequence calls on the
same object such as scaling and translating (positioning) an object. My understanding of "Learning Dart Basics" involves gaining foundational knowledge of the Dart programming language, which is essential for building applications in Flutter and other Dart-based frameworks. I also learn the basic syntax of Dart, including its case sensitivity, entry point (main() function), and how it organizes code. Dart is a powerful, object oriented programming language optimized for client side development, its often used with frameworks like flutter for building mobile, web and desktop apps.
