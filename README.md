# CHAPTER_3
#Learning Dart Basics

In this chapter, I learned that the widget tree is the result of nested widgets. As the number of
widgets increases, the widget tree expands quickly and lessens code readability and manageability. To improve code readability and manageability, you can separate widgets into their own widget class, creating a shallower widget tree. In each app, you should strive to
keep the widget tree shallow.
By refactoring with a widget class, you can take advantage of Flutterâ€™s subtree rebuilding, which
improves performance. My understanding of "Learning Dart Basics" involves gaining foundational knowledge of the Dart programming language, which is essential for building applications in Flutter and other Dart-based frameworks. I also learn the basic syntax of Dart, including its case sensitivity, entry point (main() function), and how it organizes code. Dart is a powerful, object oriented programming language optimized for client side development, its often used with frameworks like flutter for building mobile, web and desktop apps.
